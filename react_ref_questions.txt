1) var a = [1,2,3,4,3,3,4,4,2,2,4,4];

write a program to get the number of items repeated

// Ex:output - 2 three times, 3 three times,4 five times and so on

 

2) reverse an array without using built in function as well as third variable

var a =[1,2,3,4,5];

//output - a =[5,4,3,2,1];

not b as third variable like b =[5,4,3,2,1];

 

3) reverse of each element of an array

var a =[1,2,3,4,5,6];

//output - [2,1,4,3,6,5];

 

4) how search is working and fetching the result while typing google.com or anything in URL

 

5) how css will work

     div,p

     div p

    div > p

 

6) inline style {bg:red}

   external css {bg:blue}

which background is going to effect red or blue

 

if some style in jquery also like

$('#id').css('background', green)

which background is going to effect red or blue or green
